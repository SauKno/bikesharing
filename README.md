# NYC Bikesharing
## Overview of Analysis
The tableau story can be seen in its entirety at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeSharing_16492611413960/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). 

This project used data from New York City's bikeshare program to provide investors with an overall review of the bikeshare program. This information is intended to inform investors on how to best begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. Though Des Moines, Iowa is very different than NYC, this analysis is valuable in answering some key questions:

1. Who uses bikeshare programs?
2. When are bikes used the most (time of day and day of the week)?
3. How much are the bikes used and by whom?

## Results
While the demographics are different between the two locations, a look at who uses CitiBike the most can reveal some details as to who a bikeshare would most appeal to, regardless of location.

### Trip Duration

The image above shows you the duration of rides for users. As you can see, most trips do not last more than an hour, which means the number of bikes needed should take into consideration the duration bikes are needed. 

### Average Trip Duration by Birth Year

The duration of the ride fluctated by the age of the rider. There are two main things to take away from this chart. (1) The bikeshare in NYC covers all age demographics. If you can ride a bike, you can use the bikeshare. (2) Though there are some outliers, teenagers and 20-somethings take longer rides than other ages overall.


### Usage by Day of the Week

In order to further investiage the usage, this image shows you the usage of the bikeshare program by day of the week as well as the time of the day. Monday through Friday had their highest usage at 6am-9am and 4pm-8pm, which is consistent with the morning and evening commute. The weekends saw a more even distribution of rides between 9am and 4pm. This suggests that those riding during teh week use the bikeshare to commute to work, while it provides individuals a fun outdoor activity to enjoy during the day on the weekends. 

### Bikeshare Usage by Time of Day and Weekday as well as Gender

This heatmap breaks the daily usage down even further to show the gender disparities in the usage of the bikeshare program by day of the week and hours of each day. As you can seek, males tend to participate in the bikeshare program much more than any other gender.

In addition, the morning and evening commutes show the highest usage, except for Wednesdays (further investigation would be needed to determine why there is lower usage on this day). The weekends show a fairly evenly distributed usage throughout the middle of the day, ith the lowest usage between 12am and 5am. 

### Bikeshare Usage by Gender

In the image above further demonstrates that males are the predominant participants in the bikeshare program.  

### Bikeshare Usage by Membership and Gender
![Screen Shot 2022-04-06 at 5 43 26 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94129215/162077650-88a49ce0-e0a7-4774-97d2-e8ecf3acb3f4.png)

The heatmap above tells a similar story as the majority of members are male with significaly higher rates of usage than the females. The non-members do not show as much of a disparity, but the males still out numbered the females on each day.

### Peak Hour of Usage

In examining the hours of usage, you are able to see a similar story as you found in the heatmap above. The peak hours are consistently during the morning and evening commute, with the evening commute seeing more usage and the lowest usage being between 12am and 5am. This would be a great time to set up repairs, cleaning, and setting bikes out at the bikeshare stations. 

## Summary

Bikeshare programs are very popular in an urban setting. It provides people with a recreational option when looking for something fun to do around the city as well as a cheaper commuter option for work. The bikeshare also promotes a healthy lifestyle, which allows people to get to work and build their health. The user base is mostly male, which is who provides the bikeshare and program subscription the most consistent financial benefit. In setting up the bikeshare in Iowa, investors need to focus on marketing more toward woman to widen their participant base as relying on one demographic has its own challenges. In addition, the main usage revolved around the morning and evening commute, which means this is a key time to focus the promotion of the program. 

Given the information revealed in this analysis, I encourage investors to further investigate the following:
1. Trip start and stop locations. This will provide you more insight on where to station your bikeshare sets.
2. The change in ride duration based on gender as they age.
3. Days of the week commuters often stay late for drinks or dinner with colleagues.
